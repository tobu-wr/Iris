# Iris

Iris is a WIP GameBoy Advance (and Nintendo DS in the future) emulator.<br>
The goal is to provide a user-friendly experience with good enough accuracy and speed to play most games without major issues.<br>
It requires a BIOS dump of an original GameBoy Advance. The BIOS dump file must be named `gba_bios.bin` and located at the root of the emulator.<br>
